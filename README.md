🖼️ Image Steganography Project

Hide Secret Messages Inside Images Using Python

This project implements Image Steganography, a technique used to hide confidential data inside images without changing their visible appearance. It allows users to encode (hide) and decode (retrieve) secret text messages securely.

🔧 Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV / Pillow

NumPy

Tkinter / Flask (if UI used)

LSB (Least Significant Bit) algorithm

✨ Features

Hide text inside an image using LSB method

Extract hidden text from the stego-image

Simple and user-friendly interface

Supports PNG and JPG image formats

Ensures data privacy and security

Lightweight and fast

📌 How It Works

User selects an image

Enters a secret message

Algorithm hides message inside pixel values

Encoded image can be saved and shared

Decode option retrieves the hidden message back

🚀 Future Enhancements

Password-protected encoding

Encryption for added security

Audio/Video steganography

Web-based UI with React/Flask

AI-based steganalysis prevention
